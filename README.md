# scripting_playground
### A repo to store various tests and work in progress scripts ###

These scripts have been created in most cases for specific needs and put here to make them evolve and update with time.  Many scripts may also lack of proper error control so use them with that in mind and improve them as needed, again share your work, it's fun.
#### Please fork and propose your pull requests to evolve and help create a better world... ####

You will also find other repos on the same concept but different scripting languages
- [Terraform playground](https://github.com/netadvanced/terraform_playground)
- More to come when I take time to centralise it all.
